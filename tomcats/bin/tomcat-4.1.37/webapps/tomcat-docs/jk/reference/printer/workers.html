<p>
A <b>Tomcat worker</b> is a Tomcat instance that is waiting to execute servlets or any other content
on behalf of some web server. For example, we can have a web server such as
Apache forwarding servlet requests to a Tomcat process (the worker) running behind it.
</p>
<p>
The scenario described above is a very simple one;
in fact one can configure multiple Tomcat workers to serve servlets on
behalf of a certain web server.
The reasons for such configuration can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We want different contexts to be served by different Tomcat workers to provide a
development environment where all the developers share the same web server but
own a Tomcat worker of their own.
</li>
<li>
We want different virtual hosts served by different Tomcat processes to provide a
clear separation between sites belonging to different companies.
</li>
<li>
We want to provide load balancing, meaning run multiple Tomcat workers each on a
machine of its own and distribute the requests between them.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are probably more reasons for having multiple workers but I guess that this list is enough...
</p>
<p>
Tomcat workers are defined in a properties file dubbed <b>workers.properties</b> and this tutorial
explains how to work with it.

<br>
<p>Often one wants to use the same property values for various workers.
To reduce duplication of configuration lines and to ease the maintenance of
the file, you can inherit properties from one worker to another, or even
from a template to real workers.
</p>
<p>
The directive "reference" allows to copy configurations between workers
in a hierarchical way. If worker castor sets <b>worker.castor.reference=worker.pollux</b>
then it inherits all properties of <b>pollux</b>, except for the ones that
are explicitely set for <b>castor</b>.
</p>
<p>
Please note, that the value of the directive is not only the name of the referred worker,
but the complete prefix including "worker.".
</p>
<p>
To use a template worker simply define it like a real worker, but do not add it
to the "worker.list" or as a member to any load balancer. Such a template worker
does not have to contain mandatory directives. This approach is especially useful,
if one has a lot of balanced workers in a load balancer
and these workers share most of their properties. You can set all of these properties
in a template worker, e.g. using the prefix "worker.template1", and then simply
reference those common properties in all balanced workers.
</p>
<p>
References can be used to inherit properties over multiple hops in a hierarchical way.

<p>Load balancer is a virtual worker that does not really communicate with Tomcat workers.
Instead it is responsible for the management of several "real" workers.
The worker is supposed to be a load balancer if it's worker type is <b>lb</b>.

</p>
<p>Loadbalancer directives defines the parameters needed to create a workers that are
connecting to a remote cluster of backend Tomcat servers. Each cluster node has to
have a worker defined.

Load balancer management includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Instantiating the workers in the web server.
</li>
<li>
Using the worker's load-balancing factor, perform weighed-round-robin load balancing where
high lbfactor means stronger machine (that is going to handle more requests)
</li>
<li>
Keeping requests belonging to the same session executing on the same Tomcat worker.
</li>
<li>
Identifying failed Tomcat workers, suspending requests to them and instead fall-backing on
other workers managed by the lb worker.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overall result is that workers managed by the same lb worker are load-balanced
(based on their lbfactor and current user session) and also fall-backed so a single
Tomcat process death will not "kill" the entire site.

Please note, that session stickyness and perfect load balancing are
conflicting targets, especially when the number

For huge numbers of sessions this usually is not a problem.
<p>
Some methods note, that they aggregate in a sliding time window. They add up
accesses, and on each run of the global maintain method, the load counters
get divided by 2. Usually this happens once a minute, depending on the
setting of worker.maintain. The value of the load counters can be inspected
using the status worker.

working well for most applications.
</p>
<p>
If method is set to <b>S[ession]</b> the balancer will use number of sessions
to find the best worker. Accesses will be distributed according to the
lbfactor in a sliding time window. Because the balancer does not keep any state,
it actually does not know the number of sessions. Instead it counts each request
without a session cookie or URL encoding as a new session. This method will neither
know, when a session is being invalidated, nor will it correct its load numbers
according to session timeouts or worker failover. This method should be used,
if sessions are your limiting resource, e.g. when you only have limited memory
and your sessions need a lot of memory.
</p>
<p>
If set to <b>T[raffic]</b> the balancer will use
the network traffic between JK and Tomcat to find the best worker.

This method should be used, if network to and from the backends is your

</p>
<p>
If set to <b>B[usyness]</b> the balancer will
pick the worker with the lowest current load, based on how many requests the

For every load balancer worker, the status worker shows a summary
of the state of its members. There are three such states,
"good", "bad" and "degraded".
<p>
These states are determined depending on the activation of the members
(active, disabled, stopped) and their runtime state
(ok, n/a, busy, recovering, probing, forced recovery, error).
By default, members are assumed to be "good", if their activation
is "active" and their runtime state is not "error".
</p>
<p>
You can change this mapping, by assigning a list of values to the
attribute "good". Each value gives a possible match for the members,
and one match suffices. Each value is either a single character, or two
characters combined with a dot ".". The single characters are the
first characters in the words "active", "disabled", "stopped",
"ok", "na", "busy", "recovering", "error". The additional states "probing"
and "forced recovery" are always rated equivalent to "recovering".
If a value consists only
of a single character, then all members with this activation or runtime
state will be assumed good. A combination of an activation and a runtime
state concatenated with a dot "." does only apply to a member, that has
exactly this activation and state.
</p>
<p>
Members of a load balancer will first be matched against the state "bad",
if they don't match, the state "good" will be tried, and if they
still don't match, their state will be "degraded".

The parameter is the number of milliseconds to wait for success during a read event.
So this is not a timeout for the complete answer time of a request, but only
for the maximum time between two packets received from Tomcat. Usually the longest
pause is between sending the request and getting the first packet of the response.
<p>
If the timeout passes without any data received from Tomcat, the webserver will
no longer wait for the rest of the response and send an error to the client (browser).
Usually this does not mean, that the request is also aborted on the Tomcat backend.
If the worker is a member of a load balancer, the load balancer might place the
worker into an error state and retry the request on another member.

By default (value zero) the webserver will wait forever which could be an issue for you.

Cachesize defines the number of connections made to the AJP backend that
are maintained as a connection pool.
It will limit the number of those connection that each web server child
process can make.
<p>
Cachesize property is used only for multi threaded 
web servers such as Apache 2.0 (worker), IIS and Netscape. The cachesize property
should reflect the number of threads per child process. JK will discover
the number of threads per child process on Apache 2 web server with worker-mpm and set
its default value to match the ThreadsPerChild Apache directive. For IIS the default
value is 10. For other web servers than Apache or IIS this value has to be set manually.

Cache timeout property should be used with <b>cachesize</b> to specify how to time JK should keep
an open socket in cache before closing it. This property should be used to reduce the number of threads 
on the Tomcat web server.
<p> 
Each child could open an ajp13 connection if it have to forward a request to Tomcat, creating
a new ajp13 thread on Tomcat side.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that after an ajp13 connection is created, the child won't drop it
until killed. And since the webserver will keep its childs/threads running
to handle high-load, even it the child/thread handle only static contents, you could
finish having many unused ajp13 threads on the Tomcat side.

The number of seconds that told webserver to cut an ajp13 connection after some time of 
inactivity. When choosing an endpoint for a request and the assigned socket is open, it will be
closed if it was not used for the configured time.
It's a good way to ensure that there won't too old threads living on Tomcat side, 
with the extra cost you need to reopen the socket next time a request be forwarded.
